policies:
  - Late assignments will be penalized at 20% per day
  - Assignments submitted after five days will still be evaluated if you would like feedback, although the final grade will still be zero.
  - Late submissions without penalty will be considered only if the appropriate channels (doctorâ€™s note, student declaration of absence) are used.
