This course will involve 4 hands-on assignments that give you practical experience in applying methods and algorithms taught in class.
These will accompany each of the non-introductory modules and will be due the subsequent week (see specific assignments or syllabus for due dates).

As explained in more detail in the handout for assignment 2, we will largely be using the `timberlea.cs.dal.ca` server for command line analyses in later assignments.
Logging into this server will require a [CSID](https://csid.cs.dal.ca/) so please get in contact if you don't currently have one and we can get one setup.

Completed answers must be submitted via *Brightspace* in either .docx or .pdf format named using the following convention: "BannerID\_LastName\_AssignmentX.{pdf,docx}"

Assignments can be downloaded below (with additional info on the assignment page).
